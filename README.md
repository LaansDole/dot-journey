# Welcome to my in a nutsh journey
## Getting Started
You just need to remove the `.txt` on all files move them to the root (`~`) of your terminal
### Before .zshrc
To list only hidden files on a Mac, you can use the `ls` command with the `-ld` option followed by `.*`. Here's the command:

```bash
ls -ld .*
```

This command will list all files in the current directory that start with a dot (`.`), which is the convention for hidden files on Unix-like systems, including macOS.

### After .zshrc
To list all files that start with a dot (`.`) from terminal CLI, run `ll`
